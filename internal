# IJC437 Coursework – Billboard Chart Success (2000–2023)

This project investigates whether Spotify audio features are associated with chart success in the Billboard Hot 100 between 2000 and 2023. Chart success is measured using a song’s peak Billboard position (lower values indicate higher success) and a Top-10 classification.

# Research questions

1. Which Spotify audio features are most strongly associated with peak chart position?
2. How have the audio characteristics of Top-10 songs changed over time?
3. Can Top-10 chart success be predicted using Spotify audio features?

# Overview of the analysis

The dataset combines Billboard Hot 100 chart data with Spotify audio features. The analysis follows an exploratory-to-modelling workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory visualisation, correlation analysis, and simple classification models.

Repeated weekly chart entries were collapsed so that each song appears once, using its best (lowest) peak chart position. A binary Top-10 variable was then created to support classification analysis.

## Key results and figures

### Associations with peak chart position
Scatterplots show the relationships between peak chart position and selected audio features. Because lower peak positions indicate higher success, negative relationships suggest that higher values of a feature are associated with better chart outcomes.

### Changes in Top-10 songs over time
Yearly averages of audio features were compared between Top-10 and non–Top-10 songs to isolate trends specific to highly successful tracks.

### Predicting Top-10 success
Logistic regression and a decision tree were used to assess whether Top-10 success can be predicted from Spotify audio features alone.
