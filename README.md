# IJC437 Coursework- Billboard Chart Success

This repository contains my analysis for the IJC437 Introduction to Data Science coursework
Tis project investigates whether Spotify audio features can explain and predict song success on the Billboard Hot 100 between the years of 2000 and 2023

#My Research Questions

1. Which Spotify audio features are most strongly associated with peak Billboard chart position?
2. How have the audio characteristics of Top 10 songs changed over time?
3. Can Top 10 chart success be predicted using Spotify audio features?
